Po.st boosts social sharing, provides detailed analytics and monetizes the sharing that is already happening on your site.

== Description ==

Po.st is the first and only social sharing platform that offers publishers the ability to monetize the social activity on their site. Our unique “after-the-share unit” makes it easy for publishers to generate revenue from a 300x250 ad unit that appears within the social sharing confirmation box. These units receive premium CPMs (up to $25 on top sites) and display ads from Fortune 500 companies running digital campaigns with Po.st’s parent company, RadiumOne.

The Po.st plugin includes access to all major social channels including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, Reddit and email. Po.st offers an array of button styles as well—choose from small, medium or large buttons, placed vertically or horizontally, with or without share counters.

Po.st’s analytics dashboard provides a breakdown of your site’s sharing activity, from the virality of your content across social channels to where your content is shared and how many click-backs occur from each share.
